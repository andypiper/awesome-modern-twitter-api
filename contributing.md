# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Awesome Modern Twitter API.

These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and [feel free to propose changes](https://github.com/andypiper/awesome-modern-twitter-api/discussions) to this project.

---

Please ensure your Pull Request adheres to the following criteria:

- One new link per Pull Request. This makes it more straightforward to ask questions, or assess and get feedback from the community about project awesomeness üòé
  - fixes for typos or broken links, and suggested new text content, may skip this requirement. For new section proposals, start with a [discussion](https://github.com/andypiper/awesome-modern-twitter-api/discussions).
- No purely-commercial promotion; apps and links will be vetted for awesomeness üôÇ
- The policy is that the list only includes projects related to Twitter API v2 ‚è´ therefore, not all Pull Requests may immediately be merged.
  - Twitter API v1.1 projects _will not be added_. v1.1 is The Past: it is no longer being updated, and it will ultimately be retired. This list is all about the present and future üöÄ
  - The goal is to curate a list of _maintained and useful_ resources. In the case of libraries, there should be solid coverage of the API. Dead links or abandoned projects will be removed.
- Use the [awesome-linter](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint/) to check that your entry is well-formatted ‚úçÔ∏è

If you want to propose an addition but are not sure how to proceed, please ask a question via the project [Discussions](https://github.com/andypiper/awesome-modern-twitter-api/discussions) on GitHub.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
